# Storytelling✏️

## Once upon a time...
My journey came when my mother bought a painting book for beginners. I was fascinated by how someone could create such a beautiful thing out of nothing. After several months, when the rest of the family lost interest in the book, I persevered and began to develop in an artistic direction.

## Step by step
After a painting course, where I had figural drawing for the first time ... (interesting experience) I started studying at the DUKE art high school - design and art, book culture, and economics in Náhorní. I learned to work with watercolors, acryls and oil painting.

I met my passion for design in high school, where I found out what I would like to do in life and what I really enjoy.

I work in a sports center, where I am a graphic designer and a bit of a marketing specialist. My work is - posters, posts on social networks, stickers, event planning, promotion, ...

I love this place! Creative work is connected with my second job as a jumping coach!
I have been doing this sport since I was 16 years old. It's relaxation, work, fun and inspiration!

But when we talk about inspirational people...


I don't know if it's possible to say who inspires me, because on Facebook groups, Instagram, Pinterest, ... is many wonderfuless arts. Maybe i have some favorite artist, who I check more time on social media.

### Dinara Kasko 
Dinara is Pastry chef (Pastry and baking arts is more about desserts.) She studied to be an architect but chose to retire from her career as a 3D visualizer and take up baking. Kasko's main method baking involves using a 3D printer to construct a silicon mold that could then be used to shape a cake. Her works of confectionery art employ the mathematical principles of the Voronoi diagram and biomimicry. I like her style and coupling 3D designu with baking, sometimes I stay only with open eyes, how it is wondefull.
