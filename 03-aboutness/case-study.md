## Action
For the logo and manual, I have five days. My client wants something basic, funny, and mainly with vegetables.  Ok, let's do it! 

I choose a variety of colours fresh vegetables and a dark contrast box. The next step was to make a manual for them.  Project Kůlna - how to work with logo ( no deform, size, symbol), which colours use, how logo gets to clothes, etc.
