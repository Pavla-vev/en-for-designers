# Review

## 1. What did you like most about this subject?
I liked the way the lessons focused on self-presentation. Think more about your work and talk about it in front of people.

## 2. What did you like least about this subject?
I had no problem. The only problem I had with nervousness before the presentation, the stress was unnecessary, there is nothing to fear.

## 3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?
1) That I should not be afraid to speak English, even if there is not everything grammatically correct. 2) Be able to convince the client why she should be ok with my work for him. 3) Working in programs,what I don't know so much and learned more about it.

## 4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?
Probably a more detailed talk about graphic work for the client. Talk about the problems that were there, solutions, and their communication with me.

## 5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?
I am proud of the project, which I also do as a bachelor's thesis. There will still be a lot to implement and change, but then I will know that somewhere out there is all my job.

## 6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?
that I don't have to be afraid to talk to friends when I'm doing a presentation or about private things. They're here for me.

## 7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?
Maybe I'd like to talk more if I don't dare. Conversations about topics in graphics, advertising, or campaigns.

## 8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?
Probably not doing things at the last minute...Ups

## 9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?
 Probably let students talk more and tell them their most common mistakes in communication and grammar.
 
## 10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?
There is nothing to fear. Talk, get your homework on time, the lessons with Justin are great. Enjoy it.
