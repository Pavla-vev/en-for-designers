Acknowledgement(s): I dedicate this work to my mother, who has been my support throughout my studies and life events. I would also like to thank you for the opportunity to take part in her private project, and thus become part of the rescue of the historic building with respect for its past.
I would also like to thank the supervisor of my bachelor's thesis, Mr. MgA. Miroslav
Roubíček for his great help, a lot of time, support and valuable advice he gave me, throughout my bachelor's degree at this school.
