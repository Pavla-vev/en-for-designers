# My thesis project üè† Logo, vizual identity for the guest-house

## Summary
In my bachelor thesis I'm writing about create a logo and visual identity for a historic guest house.
I would like to focus on the visual side, but at the same time I would focus on its communication output through entering the online market (social contributions and communication with the target group).

I chose my job at the instigation of my mother's pension, which starts from scratch. It is in the reconstruction phase, so it is a great opportunity to be able to intervene in things that are completely impossible in other cases. Since it is a real project that will work, it will expand my portfolio, and at the same time I will help my mother with her "startup".

### What problems did the project solve?

It's a new project,so I have to do:
‚û°Ô∏è Analyze the target group, local competition
‚û°Ô∏è Do a search for similar accommodation
‚û°Ô∏è Come up with a completely new logo with a visual identity and marketing communication.
