# My thesis project üè† Logo, vizual identity for the guest-house

## Summary
In my bachelor thesis I'm writing about create a logo and visual identity for a historic guest house.
I would like to focus on the visual side, but at the same time I would focus on its communication output through entering the online market (social contributions and communication with the target group).

I chose my job at the instigation of my mother's pension, which starts from scratch. It is in the reconstruction phase, so it is a great opportunity to be able to intervene in things that are completely impossible in other cases. Since it is a real project that will work, it will expand my portfolio, and at the same time I will help my mother with her "startup".

I want to create a different accommodation facility for this location, which would attract new clients to the territory of Bohemian Switzerland.
#### Research ‚Äî design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations: 
Thanks to the new project, I have the opportunity to work with an architect who will provide me with drawings of the house. I have to focus on the competition (how it works with social networks, websites and communication with clients).
#### Findings (highlight outcome of research): 
I will create a new and original visual and marketing communication. I will help save the dilapidated historical monument.
