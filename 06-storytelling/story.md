# Storytelling‚úèÔ∏è

## Once upon a time...
My journey came when my mother bought a painting book for beginners. I was fascinated by how someone could create such a beautiful thing out of nothing. After several months, when the rest of the family lost interest in the book, I persevered and began to develop in an artistic direction. I met my passion for design in high school, where I found out what I would like to do in life and what I really enjoy. 

## What do you believe in? What‚Äôs your design philosophy?‚ú®
I think that every logo, visual identity or other design must have story - What mean this? Why you did it ? This questions must be answer. I believe in simple and clear design. The hardest from this creative process is do original and clear symbol (for example logo) - When is it nice symbol without idea or meaning, so it wrong. Everything must have a reason.

## Who inspired/inspires you?  Where does your inspiration come from? üîç
I don't know if it's possible to say who inspires me, because on Facebook groups, Instagram, Pinterest, ... is many wonderfuless arts. Maybe i have some favorite artist, who I check more time on social media.

### Dinara Kasko 
Dinara is Pastry chef (Pastry and baking arts is more about desserts.) She studied to be an architect but chose to retire from her career as a 3D visualizer and take up baking. Kasko's main method baking involves using a 3D printer to construct a silicon mold that could then be used to shape a cake. Her works of confectionery art employ the mathematical principles of the Voronoi diagram and biomimicry. I like her style and coupling 3D designu with baking, sometimes I stay only with open eyes, how it is wondefull.
