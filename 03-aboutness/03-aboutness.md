## About Me
My artist way started when I was four. I was painting in a basic programme for Windows. That was Windows 2003, if I have good memories.

When I was in eighth class in primary school I started visiting artist course. There was the first step that get me to know what I want to be as an adult.
 
Graphic designer...Wow! 
It sounds so nobly right? 
When I go with someone out a tell him, what I do, he is surprised. 

This job is about creativity, creating something from nothing, getting jokes and nice visuals to the world, it is a very fanny and inspired job.
