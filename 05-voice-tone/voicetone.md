# Voice & Tone
I tried to be relaxed in my presentation, but when I'm stressed, start laughing. It's not bad, but then my presentation is not credible...Let's be calm, I'll try it next semester!

# VoiceðŸŽ¤
Thanks to the voice we can create, communicate, share creation (etc. singing, interpreting, ..).The best thing about the voice is that we can make it special. We can add and subtract volume, express mood, draw attention to ourselves. I like to work with the voice during the presentation, "forcing" the listener to listen. At the beginning it is better to be a little louder and attract the audience, then I work with the voice according to the situation. Voice helps us sell, defend and add value to our work.

# ToneðŸŽ¶
Unlike the voice, we can express emotions in a tone (joy, jokes, irony, drama...).
